# R code chunks

This below is an R code chunk:

```{r}
data(mtcars)

plot(mtcars)
```


The code chunk above will appear in the final output. 
The code chunk below will be hidden:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
data(iris)

plot(iris)
```


This next code chunk will not be evaluated:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
data(titanic)

str(titanic)
```


The last one below runs, but code and output from the code is 
not shown in the final document. This is useful for loading 
libraries and hiding startup messages:

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```
